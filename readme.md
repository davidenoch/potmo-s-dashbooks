Welcome to my "dashbook" space. A dashbook is a cross between a `dashboard` and a `notebook`. 
  - **Dashboard:** Generally filled with lots of graphs, tables and single-value boxes, with little in the way of words. These are useful as 
  references for analysts, and tend to offer a wealth of information. Preferably these dashboards are interactive (users can tweak parameters)
  and remain timely; the charts update as time goes by. These are extremely useful. The downside is, that they are often crowded,
  with no single insights or story being told. Too often, quantity takes precedence over quality, with every square inch of screen
  real estate needing to be filled. Form upstages function too often as well sometimes, with a multicolored display chosen over a 
  less spectacular, but clearer representation of the data.
  
  - **Notebook:** Most of what I do is done using Jupyter Notebooks. I personally find this work flow very convenient. For those who don't know, 
  it is basically a set of 'cells', which contain code, markdown, text, images, output generated from code, input objects and more. I pretty much do all 
  my work in this type of environment. I sometimes use Flipsidecrypto's Velocity app. The workflow is very similar, with query results being mapped into 
  charts, and markdown and image widgets available to be inserted on the page. No Python for this, just SQL. These are more suitable for a story telling 
  approach, where a thesis is presented or a topic is explored in depth. 
  
  Most "bounties", "posts", "articles", "tweets", "analyses", etc. will be presented in some kind of combintation of the two entities described above.
  I therefore will refer to these things as "*dashbooks*" or 'dashes' (with the understanding that that is short for dashbook and not dashboard).
  
  This is soon to be a complete collection of all my work.There is a lot of crap! This is not intended as an exhibition or portfolio.
  
  If you are a friend providing feedback or a professional head hunter or career coach, I of course welcome your opinions, as to which notebooks to use
  and how to improve. From this, I hope to refine the best or most interesting ones. If you are judging my ability, I only ask that you recognize that these 
  dashbooks are nearly always being done under a time constraint, as opposed to being finished products. 
  
  For a showcase, please checkout my profiles on Datacamp, LinkedIN and Flipsidecrypto. (links coming)
  
  As I collect and review all my dashbooks, I will grab some useful snippets of code, which I find myself reusing (or wishing I could remember 
  where it was) and organize them in one place. That's the plan anyway.
